# Doable: Opinionated kanban

Hackable opinionated kanban board:
* Feels like Trello / github
* With smart autocompletion (thanks Wekan), including # for labels and / for dates

## Doable runs on conventions

See [opinionatedFeatures.js](client/config/opinionatedFeatures.js)
* `..` for waiting, ðŸ”¥ for urgent, â­• for risky, etc
* Filtering allows to quickly filter down to tag, emoji, important, or fulltext
* Dims delegated, waiting, and deferred tasks; multiple focus levels
* Adds support for dividers (which can shade for you)
* Works on mobile, but needs improvement
* Minimalistic fullscreen UI without clutter
